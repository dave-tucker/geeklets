dave's geeklets
===============

This is a collection of geeklets for [GeekTool](http://sourceforge.net/projects/geektool/)

## Usage

    cp weather-config-sample.yaml weather/config.yaml

Edit `weather/config.yaml` with your [Dark Sky](http://forecast.io) API Key, Latitude and Longitude

Edit `BASEDIR` in `weather/darksky-forecast.rb` to point to the right location on your machine. 

You can then import the geeklets, remebering to change the path to the script, and then enjoy!
